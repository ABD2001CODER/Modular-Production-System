# Modular-Production-System
# 🤖 PLC-Based Pick-and-Place Sorting System

A practical automation project completed at **SLIR (Sri Lanka Institute of Robotics)**. This system simulates an industrial **pick-and-place and sorting** station using PLC logic, conveyors, sensors, and pneumatic actuators.

## 🔧 Features

- 🚚 3 Conveyor Belts (CNV-1, CNV-2, CNV-3)
- 🧲 Suction pick-up with rod-less actuator
- ⚙️ Pneumatic cylinders for sorting
- 🔥 Heating module simulation
- 📦 Object detection using sensors (S1–S7)
- 🧠 PLC control with ladder logic, timers, and memory bits

## 🧠 Skills Gained

- PLC Programming (Ladder Diagram)
- Sensor integration & process control
- Industrial automation & troubleshooting
